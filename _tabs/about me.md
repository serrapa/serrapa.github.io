My name is Paolo Serra, a pentester currently focused on Application security most of the time. I often deal with Web and Mobile Security, but I  also adore Machine Learning: it blows me away, and that's why automating tasks, getting them done and creating AIs are my best-loved things to do when I have time to lose. I like creating and playing CTFs, analyzing tools and reading other people's blogs. 

I don't want to write blog posts similar to those tons of articles out there, but something more exotic, uncommon, helpful and interesting. Hope you enjoy the reading!
