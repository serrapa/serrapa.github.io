My name is Paolo Serra, currently a pentester most of the time focused on Application security, with a background of black box assessments. Beyond Web and Mobile, I do adore Machine Learning, it blows me away and that's why automating boring tasks, getting them done and creating AIs are my best-loved things to do when I have time to lose. 

I hope you can enjoy the lectures from this blog. If you are wondering about my best achievement, you should have a look at my first post.
